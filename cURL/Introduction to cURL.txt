Introduction to cURL:

cURL is a tool for transferring data to and from a server. It can also make various types of requests. Its great for testing REST APIs and downloading files.

cURL can be viewed as an alternative to POSTMAN and can support most protocols.

In the following examples, HTTP protocol will be used.

Most linux OS's have cURL installed automatically.

To see if you have cURL installed on your PC, open the terminal and go: curl --help

This should return a list of commands you can use.


************************************

For the purpose of this tutorial the following website will be used:
http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

It is a fake online REST API that be used for testing and prototyping.

This website contains a number of resources to work with including: 
/posts
/comments
/albums
/photos
/todos
/users

Adding this extension to the existing URL will return a list of JSON data.

Adding an additional /2 will return the JSON data relating to user:2

You can carry out GET,POST,PUT,PATCH & DELETE requests. Nothing actually will be updated but you will get a response depending on how correct your request is.


************************************************

curl http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
This returns all 100 JSON records from the posts resource.

curl http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3
Returns the response with an ID of 3.

curl -i http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3
Returns all header information with the response relating to 3.

curl -I http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3
Returns just the header information.

curl -o test.txt http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3
Looks for a file in the current working directory called test.txt and saves all the post information to it.

cat test.txt
Opens this test file in the terminal.

curl -O test.txt http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
Downloads all the JSON data to a file called 'posts' with no extension.

cat posts
Opens the posts file in the terminal.


curl -O http://i.imgur.com/QRlAgOb.png 
Downloads an Image to the current working directory

curl -O --limit-rate 1000B http://i.imgur.com/QRlAgOb.png 
Downloads an Image to the Current working directory but limits the byte size.

**************

curl --data "title=Hello&body=Hello World" http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts
Post data to the server and returns the following:

{
  "title": "Hello",
  "body": "Hello World",
  "id": 101
}%

So we added a new record to the 100 already existing.

**************

curl -X PUT -d "title=Hello" http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3
You can make a PUT request/update on a specific JSON record using the following example.

**************

curl -X DELETE http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts/3
Delete request.

**************

If you needed to include authentication, such as username/password, you would include the following:

curl -u username:password ...

*************

If you have a URL that has moved you can include a -L flag to follow this redirection.

curl http://google.com

The above returns a '301 Moved' as the website does not exist at this link. If we follow this specific link in a URL, then an additional WWW will be included to go to www.google.com.

For curl to go to follow the new correct URL, add a -L flag:

curl -L http://google.com
