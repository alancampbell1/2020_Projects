NodeJS MySQL Delete:

You can delete records from an existing table using the "DELETE FROM" statement. In the following example, a specific row is deleted from the table that matches a certain criteria.

var mysql = require('mysql');

var con = mysql.createConnection({

	host: "localhost",
	user: "root",
	password: "Abbeyfarm17!",
	database: "mydb"
}); 

con.connect(function(err){

	if(err) throw err;
	var sql = "DELETE FROM customers WHERE address = 'Highway 37'";
	con.query(sql, function (err, result) {

		if(err) throw err;
		console.log("Number of records deleted: " + result.affectedRows);

	});

});


NOTE: Failure to include the WHERE clause can cause all records to be deleted.
Also, the result object contains some interesting information regarding the table that can be printed to the screen such as the number of affected rows:

console.log("Number of records deleted: " + result.affectedRows);
