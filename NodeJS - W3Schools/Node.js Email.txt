Node.js Email:

The node mailer module makes it easy to send emails from your computer. It can downloaded and installed using NPM:

npm install nodemailer

(NOTE: Make sure this is in the same location as the package.json file)

After you have downloaded Nodemailer, you can include the module into your application:

var nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

****************************************

Send an email:

You need a username and password from a selected email provider to send an email. The following example uses Gmail:

var nodemailer = require('nodemailer');

//transporter object with our email source attached
var transporter = nodemailer.createTransport({
	service: 'gmail',
	auth: {
		user: 'yourmail@gmail.com',
		pass: 'yourpassword'
	}
});

//mailOptions object containing from, to, subject & text information
var mailOptions = {
	from: 	 'yourmail@gmail.com',
	to:   	 'myfriends@yahoo.ie',
	subject: 'Sending email using Node.js',
	text:	 'That was easy!'
}; 

//Carrying out the sendMail() function to send an email
transporter.sendMail(mailOptions, function(error, info)){
	if(error) {
		console.log(error);
	} else {
		console.log('Email Sent: ' + info.response);
	}
});

****************************************

Multiple Receivers:

To send an email to multiple receivers, add them to the 'to' properties option in mailOptions like so:

var mailOptions = {
	from: 	 'youremail@gmail.com',
	to:   	 'myfirst@gmail.com, mysecond@gmail.com',
	subject: 'test',
	text:	 'That was simple.'
}

****************************************

Send HTML:
To send HTML we add it to a new property called 'html' in the mailOptions object which replaces 'text':

var mailOptions = {
	from:    'youremail@gmail.com',
	to:	 'myfriend@yahoo.com',
	subject: 'Sent using Node.js',
	html:	 '<h1>Welcome</h1><p>That was straight forward.<p>'
}
