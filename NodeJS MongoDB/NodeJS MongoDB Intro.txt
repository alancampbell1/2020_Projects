*************************************************

What is MongoDB:

MongoDB is a document orientated NoSQL Database used for high volume data storage. Instead of using tables and rows, MongoDB makes use of collections and documents. 
Documents consist of key-value pairs which are the basic unit of data in MongoDB.
Collections contain sets of documents and functions which is the equivalent of relational databases. 

Key features:
- Each Database contains collections which in turn contains documents. Each document can be different with a varying number of fields.
- The document structure is more in line with how developers construct their classes and objects in their respective languages.
- The rows (or documents in MongoDB) doesn't need to have a schema defined beforehand. Instead, fields can be created on the fly.
- Documents are similar to JavaScript objects or JSON objects. It's very scalable, fast and flexible.
- You don't have to map out your entire data structure unlike with relational databases that need all the tables and columns defined before you put data into them.
