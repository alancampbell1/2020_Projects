How to create a React Application from scratch:

Make sure NPM and Node.js are installed and the latest versions are update to date.

Navigate to where you want to save the Application.

Run the command:
npx create-react-app- myfirstreact

'myfirstreact' is the name of the application.

'create-react-app' will set up everything you need to run a React application.

To run the new application you must navigate into the app and run the following command:
npm start

This will open a new browser window using localhost and port 3000.
