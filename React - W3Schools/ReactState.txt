React State:
React components have an inbuilt state object.

This object is where you store values that belong to the component.

When the state object changes so does the component.

**************************

Creating the state object:

The state object is initialised in the constructor of a Component. It can contain as many properties as you like.

*Remember, when creating constructors in Components to pass any props to the super() constructor in React.Component.

class WorkCar extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
		this.state = {
			brand: "Ford",,
			model: "Mustang",
			color: "black",
			year:  1985
		};
	}
 

	render() {
		return(
			<div>
				<h1>My Work Car</h1>
                 			<p>
                    			It is a {this.state.color}
                    			{this.state.brand} {this.state.model}
                    			from {this.state.year}.
                 			</p>
			</div>
		);
	}
}


**************************

Changing the state object:

To change the value in a state object, you use the this.setState() method. When a value in a state object changes, the component re-renders which means the output we see will change according to the new value.

For example, a button click changes the state value of colour property belonging to that state. Instead of the entire screen reloading, just the component changes/re-renders:

class MyBike extends React.Component {
	constructor(props) {
		super(props);
		this.state = {
			brand: "Triumph",
			model: "T-Series",
			color: "red",
			year: 2020
		};
	}

	changeColor = () => {
		this.setState({color: "blue"});
	}

	render() {
		return(
			<div>
				<h1>This is my { this.state.brand } bike</h1>
				<p>
					It is a { this.state.color }
					{ this.state.model }
					from { this.state.year }.
				</p>
				<button type="button" onClick={this.changeColor}>Change Colour</button>
			</div>
		);
	}
} 

ReactDOM.render(<MyBike />, document.getElementById('MyNewBike'));

We have declared a new function, of type Arrow Function, that calls setState on this, I.e. the state object of this component, to change the property value of color from red to blue.
The call is made from a button click that is returned to the user from the render() function that displays these settings within a div element in index.html called 'MyNewBike'.


**************************


Always use setState() method to change the state object, it will ensure that the component knows its been updated and calls the render() method.
