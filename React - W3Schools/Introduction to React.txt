React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
Developers use it to build single page applications.
It is useful in creating reusable UI Components.

In order to create a React App, you need to set up a React Environment on your PC. 
The most common method to doing this is to use create-react-app. This is officially supported by React and can be install when NPM and Node.js are installed on your PC.

To create a React App, navigate to the location where you want to the app and run the command:
npx create-react-app- myfirstreact

myfirstreact is the name of the application.

'create-react-app' will set up everything you need to run a React application.

To run the new application you must navigate into the app and run the following command:
npm start

This will open a new browser window using localhost and port 3000.

It is important you know some new JavaScript features such as ES6 when learning React.

How does React work:
React creates a Virtual DOM in memory. DOM stands for Document Object Model and is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It contains all the HTML markup we are used to.

Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, such with standard HTML and JS, React creates a virtual DOM in memory where all necessary manipulating is carried out before making the changes in the browser DOM.

One of the major advantages of React is that it only changes what needs to be changed.
It finds out what changes have been made and changes only what needs to be changed.
