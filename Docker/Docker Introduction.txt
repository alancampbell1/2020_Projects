Docker is a container management service.

The 3 keywords of Docker are Develop, Ship & Run. 

The purpose of Docker is to allow Developers to easily develop applications, ship them into containers which can then be deployed anywhere.

To run software services, e.g. Optimum T&A, Apache, MongoDB & MySQL, inside of Containers. These containers are separate from your OS and whole local machine environment.

So instead of trying to build an app on one machine and repeat the process on a second machine, if it's a different OS and has only select features installed, Docker removes the pain of getting them to match up.
Docker runs the app in the container and this will be the same no matter what OS you use.

Why use Docker:
- Docker can reduce the size of development by providing a smaller footprint of the OS by using Containers.
- By using Containers, it is easier for teams across different units, such as Development & QA Teams, to work seamlessly across applications.
- Docker can be deployed anywhere, on physical or virtual machines or on the cloud.
- Docker is lightweight so it can easily be scalable.
- Unlike VMware that creates a new OS/kernel for each VM it creates, Docker uses only the one OS/kernel with lightweight individual containers interacting with it.
- Very popular with large tech companies.

Components of Docker:
- Docker for Mac - allows a developer to run Docker Containers on the MacOS.
- Docker Engine  - Used to build Docker images and create Docker containers.
- Docker Hub     - A registry used to host various Docker images.
- Docker Compose - Used to define applications using multiple Docker containers.

****************************************

Getting Started:

Create a DockerHub account and Sign in.

Download Docker for Mac, install it and when running, sign in with your new Dockerhub account. 


What is DockerHub:

DockerHub is a registry service on the cloud that allows you to download Docker images that are built by other communities. You can also upload your own Docker images.


***************************************

Basic Commands:

In a new terminal, type the following:
Docker		-	returns list of commands
Docker version	-	returns info. On Docker engine etc.
Docker info	-	gives info. Regarding containers etc.
